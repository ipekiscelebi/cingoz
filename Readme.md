# Cingöz

Cingöz is an AI-powered system designed to automate the generation of test scripts for GUI applications. By leveraging computer vision and deep learning, Cingöz transforms raw visual input into semantically meaningful and executable test code, without requiring access to the application's internal structures.

This project includes the dataset used in our research paper, and the code used to gather images from the web. 

We used [Roboflow](https://app.roboflow.com) for: 
- Labeling the images (all GUI elements were labeled manually)
- Splitting the dataset (%70 training, %15 validation, %15 testing)
- Resize the images (fit all images to 1024x1024)
